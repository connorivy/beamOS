u -> Member local end displacment vector
v -> Member global end displacment vector



Sign Convention
The sign convention for member local fixed-end forces, Qf, is the same as that
for the member end forces in the local coordinate system, Q. Thus, the member
local fixed-end axial forces and shears are considered positive when in the positive directions of the member’s local x and y axes, and the local fixed-end
moments are considered positive when counterclockwise. However, the member loads are commonly defined to be positive in the directions opposite to those
for the local fixed-end forces. In other words, the member axial and perpendicular loads are considered positive when in the negative directions of the member’s
local x and y axes, respectively, and the external couples applied to the members
are considered positive when clockwise. The expressions for the member fixedend forces (including moments) given inside the front cover of this text are based
on this sign convention, in which all the fixed-end forces and member loads
(including couples) are shown in the positive sense.
